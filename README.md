# Linux Kernel Resources
A work in progress, this repo aims to provide a curated set of resources around the Linux kernel for researchers, developers, hobbyists and whoever else finds this stuff interesting!

## Contents
For now, the resources are divided into categories by folder, which will contain relevant resources:
* `compiling/`: notes and resources on compiling the Linux kernel & its modules from source
* `debugging/`: some more notes and resources, this time on kernel debugging (particularly gdb, @ me)
* `instrumenting/`: this will be sparser for now, but hope to include resources on kprobes, kprint and more!
* `patching/`: not sure how much will be in here, but it was a section on the plus post & who knows

### Roadmap
Mainly as a reminder for myself, and perhaps of interest to you, here's a tentative roadmap of content I'd like to add down the line:
* [ ] `development/*`: touch a bit on kernel development, provide some resources and pointers, fun project ideas etc. the idea here being to demystify kernel development as best as possible and keep things light
* [ ] `debugging/qemu-env`: i have a messy set of bash scripts to quickly spin up a minimal, lightweight VM in QEMU from kernel source; useful for quick and painless debugging setup that doesn't have too much overhead
* [ ] `instrumenting/demos`: include some demos of kprobes, ftrace etc. get some hands on; something I haven't really looked into
* [ ] General curation of the swarm of resources I've got bookmarked in various folders, as there's some great ones out there and no point in reinventing the mouse

Beyond these concrete ideas, I'll of course continue to update the repo with anything interesting I recall/learn that might be of interest.
