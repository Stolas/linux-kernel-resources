# Linux Kernel Resources
A work in progress, this repo aims to provide a curated set of resources around the Linux kernel for researchers, developers, hobbyists and whoever else finds this stuff interesting!

## Contents
For now, the resources are divided into categories by folder, which will contain relevant resources:
* `compiling/`: notes and resources on compiling the Linux kernel & its modules from source
* `debugging/`: some more notes and resources, this time on kernel debugging (particularly gdb, @ me)
* `instrumenting/`: this will be sparser for now, but hope to include resources on kprobes, kprint and more!
* `patching/`: not sure how much will be in here, but it was a section on the plus post & who knows

## Contributions
Contributions are more than welcome! From the smallest gotcha or one-line-time-saver, to technical deep dives, feel free to submit a PR if you want to add to this little project :)
